Hyperparameter

For logistic regression:
The max iteration was set to 1000 to ensure convergence.

For random forest classifier:
The random state value was 32 to ensure reproducibility. The amount of 'trees' in the forest was 100 by default.

For naive bayes:
Instead of the standardized data, I used an encoded version. The alpha was set to 1 (Additive or Laplace smoothing)

For SVM:
The kernel was set to 'linear'.
