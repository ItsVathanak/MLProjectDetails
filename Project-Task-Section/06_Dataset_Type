+ Food Product: The name of the food product.
+ Main Ingredient: The primary ingredient of the food product.
+ Sweetener: The type or presence of a sweetener used in the food product.
+ Fat/Oil: The type or presence of fat or oil used in the food product.
+ Seasoning: The spices or seasonings added to enhance the flavor of the food product.
+ Allergens: The list of allergens associated with the food product, indicating potential allergic reactions.
